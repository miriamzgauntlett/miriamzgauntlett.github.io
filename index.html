              I am a postdoctoral researcher in observational seismology at the Australian National University. My research uses seismic imaging to understand the Earth's interior structure—specifically the crust and the upper mantle.

            <p>I live and work on unceded Ngunnawal and Ngambri country.</p>

            <p>In my research, I use the energy produced by earthquakes (seismic waves) to map the interior of the Earth. It’s similar to the process of a CT scan: as the seismic waves pass through the Earth, they record information. We measure the seismic waves at sites all over the globe and use various methods to uncover this information.</p>
            <h3>current</h3>
            <p>I am working on the WA Array project with Dr Caroline Eakin, a continental-wide array of seismometers aiming to provide unprecedented insights into the structure of Western Australia's crust and mantle. Our work uses seismic anisotropy (the directional dependence of seismic wave speed) to understand the deformational history of this region—one of the oldest continents in the world. <a href="/wa_array">[more]</a></p>

              My PhD research focused on the Afar Triple Junction—the meeting point of three different continental rifts. Rifting is part of the cycle of plate tectonics: continents are subject to forces that pull them apart to form new oceans. The three rifts that converge in Afar formed when the Arabian and African plates began to separate. These rifts are at different stages of development, thus making the region an ideal place to investigate how and why rifting begins and evolves. 
            </p>I imaged the subsurface structure around the Afar Triple Junction on three different scales: upper crust, bulk crust and upper mantle. For each scale I used a different investigation technique: local earthquake traveltime tomography, receiver function analysis, and shear-wave splitting. <a href="/phd">[more]</a></p>
            <h3>masters</h3>
            <p>
              During my MSc project, I investigated the space-time characteristics of large-magnitude, deep earthquakes. These mysterious events occur at depths greater than 300 km, where the pressure and temperature within the Earth is very high. The usual mechanism for an earthquake is brittle failure; but deep events occur in regions where ductile flow of rocks would be expected instead. In contrast to their shallow counterparts, the space-time characteristics determined for deep earthquakes are often inconsistent, non-unique and poorly constrained.
