              I conducted my investigation into the <b>Afro-Arabian Rift System</b> (AARS) around the Afar Triple Junction on three different scales: <b>upper crust</b>, <b>bulk crust</b> and <b>upper mantle</b>. For each scale I used a different seismological technique: local earthquake traveltime tomography, receiver function analysis, and shear-wave splitting.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using <b>shear-wave splitting</b> of the SKS phase to measure seismic anisotropy, I showed that <b>mantle flow is coherent</b> across the three branches of the rift system. <b>Hot material in the asthenosphere upwells</b> from the core-mantle boundary beneath southern Africa, passes through the East African Rift System and reaches the base of the lithosphere beneath the Afar Triple Junction. My seismic anisotropy results demonstrated that mantle flow then <b>bifurcates</b> around the cold, thick lithosphere of the Arabian Plate, preferentially <b>travelling down the thin lithospheric corridors</b> of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden rifts.
            </p>
            <p>
              To investigate the <b>bulk crustal properties</b> across northern Afar, I used <b>teleseismic receiver functions</b> to calculate the depth of the crust and the average crustal Vp/Vs ratio. Heterogeneous crust with <b>variable crustal thickness</b> underlies the region, with <b>considerable amounts of partial melt</b> indicated by anomalously high Vp/Vs ratios. By investigating the relationship between crustal thickness and topographic elevation, I estimated that the <b>regional crustal bulk density is elevated</b> compared to the global average. Topography is higher than would be expected due to crustal isostasy alone, implying that <b>dynamic support from the mantle</b> contributes to the topography in the region.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the upper crustal scale, I investigated <b>magmatism</b> in the region—specifically,<b>Nabro volcano in Eritrea</b> following its June 2011 eruption. I used <b>local earthquake traveltime tomography</b> to invert for the the seismic velocity structure (P-wave velocity, Vp; S-wave velocity, Vs; and their ratio, Vp/Vs) beneath Nabro. Key observations were an aseismic region of low Vp, low Vs and high Vp/Vs ratio at depths of 6–10 km b.s.l., interpreted as <b>the primary melt storage region</b> that fed the eruption; a zone of high Vs, low Vp and low Vp/Vs ratio, representing an <b>intrusive complex of fractured rocks</b> partially-saturated with over-pressurised gases.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, I found that the <b>crustal structure throughout the region</b> is highly <b>complex and heterogeneous</b>. Despite this, <b>large-scale mantle dynamics underlying the AARS</b> are remarkably simple. <b>Extensional processes in the region</b> have facilitated <b>magmatism throughout the crust and upper mantle</b>, producing volcanic episodes such as Nabro volcano’s June 2011 eruption.
