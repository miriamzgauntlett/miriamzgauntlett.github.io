    <p>Western Australia is one of the <b>>oldest continental regions</b> in the world, with a complex, lengthy geological history. It contains the Yilgarn craton, a long-lived, ancient piece of continental crust that has remained stable for <b>over 2 billion years</b>.</p>

<p>Rigid continental plates record their deformation history in <b>large-scale rock fabric</b> that alters the directional dependence of seismic wave speed: a property known as <b>seismic anisotropy</b>. Current deformation occurring beneath plates as the <b>mantle flows</b> also contributes to seismic anisotropy.</p>

<p>I am using <b>shear-wave splitting</b> to measure seismic anisotropy in the south-western area of Western Australia. Our results emphasise the complexity of the Earth’s interior beneath this region. We find that seismic anisotropy likely reflects <b>past deformation events fossilised into the lithosphere</b>. These events could potentially be linked to the <b>formation of the craton</b> itself.
